2. **Enter Building Units**: Total building consumption (kWh)
3. **Previous Units**: Auto-filled from last month (editable if needed)

## 🔢 **Calculation Logic**

```
Rate per Unit = Total Bill ÷ Total Building Units

Units Consumed (per flat) = Current Reading - Previous Reading

Common Area Units = Building Total - Sum of All Flat Units
Common Area Cost per Flat = (Common Area Units × Rate) ÷ 5

Other Bills per Flat = Total Other Bills ÷ 5

Final Flat Bill = (Units Consumed × Rate) + Common Area Share + Other Bills Share
```
